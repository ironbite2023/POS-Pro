### 6. Inventory Valuation

**Valuation Methods Supported**:

**LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
- Newest stock is consumed first
- Less common in restaurants
- Available for specific use cases

**Weighted Average**
- Average cost of all units
- Smooths price fluctuations
- Simpler calculation

**Calculation Example (FIFO)**:
```
Purchase 1: 50 kg @ $5/kg = $250
Purchase 2: 30 kg @ $6/kg = $180
Current Stock: 60 kg
Stock Value: (50 kg Ã— $5) + (10 kg Ã— $6) = $310
```

- Reorder Point: (5 Ã— 3) + 5 = 20 kg
```
