- [ ] **Add signature verification** (2 hours) - Security requirement  
- [ ] **Add accept/reject + sync status** (3 hours) - Two-call pattern required
- [ ] **Test basic flow** (1 hour) - Validate implementation

#### **3. Just Eat Foundation** (10 hours total)
- [ ] **Create webhook receiver** (6 hours) - Cannot receive orders without this
- [ ] **Add time-based acceptance logic** (2 hours) - Variable timeouts required
- [ ] **Add accept/reject methods** (2 hours) - Core functionality missing

### **üî• CRITICAL PRIORITY 2 (Next Week)**

#### **4. Complete Deliveroo** (8 hours total)
- [ ] **Implement 3-minute auto-accept** (4 hours) - Prevent tablet escalation
- [ ] **Test timeout scenarios** (4 hours) - Validate critical timing

#### **5. Complete Just Eat** (12 hours total)
- [ ] **Add pre-order handling** (6 hours) - Business requirement
- [ ] **Complete accept/reject methods** (4 hours) - Full implementation  
- [ ] **Test all order types** (2 hours) - Same-day vs pre-orders

#### **6. Infrastructure** (8 hours total)
- [ ] **Complete retry queue processor** (4 hours) - Reliability requirement
- [ ] **Add monitoring and alerting** (4 hours) - Production monitoring

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Phase 1 Complete When:**
- [x] All webhook receivers deployed and functional
- [x] Webhook signature verification implemented (security)
- [x] Accept/reject order methods working on all platforms
- [x] Timeout logic prevents auto-cancellation/escalation
- [x] Basic end-to-end order flow works for all platforms

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**  
- [x] Auto-accept logic prevents operational issues
- [x] Pre-order handling supports advance orders
- [x] Retry queue processes failed webhooks
- [x] Monitoring alerts on any failures
- [x] Comprehensive testing passes

### **Production Ready When:**
- [x] Zero webhook security vulnerabilities
- [x] 100% order acceptance within timeout windows
- [x] 0% auto-cancelled or escalated orders
- [x] Staff can manage all platforms from single interface
- [x] "Tablet Hell" completely eliminated

## üíº **BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION**

### **Investment Analysis:**
- **Invested**: ~200 hours in foundations (database, UI, basic APIs)
- **Required**: ~72 hours to complete core functionality  
- **ROI**: Eliminate tablet management, prevent order losses
- **Risk of Not Completing**: All invested effort becomes unusable

### **Operational Impact:**
- **Current**: Cannot accept orders ‚Üí guaranteed revenue loss
- **Post-Fix**: Unified interface ‚Üí operational efficiency gains
- **Competitive Advantage**: Single platform management system

---

## üöÄ **RECOMMENDED EXECUTION**

### **Week 1 Focus: Get One Platform Working End-to-End**
**Recommendation**: Start with **Uber Eats** (longest timeout window, most forgiving)

1. Day 1: Fix Uber Eats webhook signature + accept/reject
2. Day 2: Fix Uber Eats status endpoints + test with sandbox
3. Day 3: Create Deliveroo webhook receiver
4. Day 4: Complete Deliveroo accept/reject + 3-minute logic  
5. Day 5: Create Just Eat webhook receiver

### **Week 2 Focus: Complete All Platforms + Infrastructure**
1. Day 6-7: Complete Just Eat implementation + pre-orders
2. Day 8: Complete retry queue processor
3. Day 9: Comprehensive testing all platforms
4. Day 10: Production deployment preparation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS**

### **Cannot Deploy Until:**
1. ‚úÖ Webhook signature verification implemented (security)
2. ‚úÖ Accept/reject methods working (core functionality)
3. ‚úÖ Timeout logic prevents order loss (business requirement)
4. ‚úÖ All platforms tested with real credentials (validation)
5. ‚úÖ Monitoring and alerting configured (operational)

### **Production Readiness Gate:**
- **Security Audit**: Pass webhook security review
- **Functional Testing**: All order acceptance scenarios work
- **Performance Testing**: Response times under timeout limits
- **Staff Training**: Team ready for unified workflow
- **Monitoring**: Alerts configured for failures

---

## üìû **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**Recommended**: Start with **Uber Eats webhook signature verification** (highest security risk, easiest fix)

**Command to execute:**
```bash
cd supabase/functions/uber-eats-webhook
# Edit index.ts to add signature verification
# Redeploy with: supabase functions deploy uber-eats-webhook
```

**Then immediately**: Add accept/reject methods to `uber-eats.client.ts`

---

## üìä **TRACKING PROGRESS**

Create tracking document: `PLATFORM_COMPLETION_TRACKER.md`
- [ ] Uber Eats: Signature ‚úÖ | Accept/Reject ‚è≥ | Status Fix ‚è≥ | Test ‚è≥
- [ ] Deliveroo: Webhook ‚è≥ | Accept/Reject ‚è≥ | Timeout ‚è≥ | Test ‚è≥  
- [ ] Just Eat: Webhook ‚è≥ | Accept/Reject ‚è≥ | Time Logic ‚è≥ | Test ‚è≥
- [ ] Infrastructure: Retry Queue ‚è≥ | Monitoring ‚è≥

**Priority Level**: üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Business Impact**: **Revenue Protection + Operational Efficiency**  
**Technical Risk**: **Manageable with focused effort**  
**Recommendation**: **Immediate implementation of identified gaps**
